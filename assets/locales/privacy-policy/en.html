  number and expiration date. <strong>By providing this personal information to us, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</strong> This information is used to provide
  the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and deliver orders, to send order and delivery confirmations and to provide customer service. This
  information also may be used for our own marketing and internal business purposes, and to contact you about sales, special offers and new site features, unless you have
  opted not to receive promotional communications in connection with this website. To serve you better, we may combine information you give us with other information that

  visited and how often, to make our website more user-friendly, and to give you a better experience when you return to the website. For example, cookies allow us to
  save your password so you do not have to re-enter it every time you visit our website. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. While
  you are free to decline cookies, we recommend that you leave cookies “turned on” so that we can offer you a better shopping experience on this website. For more detailed
  information on our use of “cookies”, including how to disable them, please visit our Cookie Policy.
